			<p>Our members are nimble thinkers and tinkerers who can do a whole bunch of stuff. Just ask us. However, so that we can understand what we do, we've split it into three main areas. How do you do these things, you ask. Good question.

	           <h5>The Workshop</h5>
			   <p>Most of us have been facilitating workshops since we were born. Some even before. They're highly participatory, and democratic.</p>
			   <h5>The Think-a-thon</h5>
			   <p>We take a visually facilitated group approach to chewing through a knotty challenge. This particularly suits new projects and ideas. Because it's a bit different, we had to invent a new word for it. </p>
			   <h5>Strategic Planning</h5>
			   <p>How the hell are we going to do that!? What a great question to ask. We'll guide you through answering it, trusting the knowledge in the room.</p>
			   <h5>The design-a-thon</h5>
			   <p>We'll take an issue and build a prototype to test with a handful of customers. All in one week. Yep, you heard me right - one week.</p>
