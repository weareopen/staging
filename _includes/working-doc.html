heading: Open our umbrella
intro-text: Our members are nimble thinkers and tinkerers who can do a whole bunch of stuff. Just ask us. However, just so that <em>we</em> can understand what we do, we've organised our "what" into three main areas.

                            <h5>The Workshop</h5>

                            <p>Most of us have been facilitating workshops since we were born. Some even before. They're highly participatory, and democratic.</p>

                            <h5>The Think-a-thon</h5>

                            <p>We take a visually facilitated group approach to chewing through a knotty challenge. This particularly suits new projects and ideas. Because it's a bit different, we had to invent a new word for it.</p>

                            <h5>Strategic Planning</h5>

                            <p>How are we going to do this!? What a great question to ask. We'll guide you through answering it, trusting the knowledge in the room.</p>

                            <h5>The design-a-thon</h5>

                            <p>We'll take an issue and build a prototype to test with a handful of customers. All in one week. Yep, you heard me right - one week.</p>

                        <h2 class="center">In terms of articulating concepts, we're a dab hand. Or hands even.</h2>

                        <div class="col s12 m4 l7">
                            <h5>Speaking</h5>

                            <p>Most of our members are accomplished speakers. Shows, Conferences, CPD days - you name it. Lasers and walk-on theme songs are of course optional, but if your conference has lasers, you should call us.</p>

                            <h5>Curating</h5>

                            <p>We're responsible for the venerable <a href="http://badge.news">Badge News</a>, the Badge Wiki, Thought Shrapnel, Freshly Brewed Thoughts, Visual Thinkery and a number of publications on Medium. We're great at pulling related stuff together, or, in high English, curation.</p>

                            <h5>Creating</h5>

                            <p>The We Are Open Co-op is filled to the brim with creativity. We do branding and visuals, we do wireframes and illustrations. We even make jam out of aloe vera. We're creative to our cores, so we make all kinds of things both digitally and in the physical reality.</p>

                            <h5>Writing</h5>

                            <p>We put words on the page. We write articles and blogposts for our audiences, ourselves and our clients. We also write novels, weeknotes, non-fiction books, academic papers, neighborhood watch guidelines, treaties and functional specs.</p>
